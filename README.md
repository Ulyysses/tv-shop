## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Launches the application in development mode using Vite. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the TypeScript source code first, then builds the application for production. This optimizes the app for the best performance and outputs the build files in the `dist` folder.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint for static code analysis to identify potential errors and issues. It checks files with `.ts` and `.tsx` extensions, reports on used and unused eslint-disable directives, and forbids any warnings.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the built app in preview mode. This allows you to view the production build in action before deploying it to a server.
